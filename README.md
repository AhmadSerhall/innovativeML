###  InnovativeML is built using the following technologies:

- This project leverages the React.js (https://reactjs.org/) which is a javascript library that allows for dynamic interfaces and reusabel ui components and is a versatile, cross-platform technology enabling a unified codebase for applications across mobile, desktop, and web platforms.
- This project utilizes MongoDB üçÉ (https://www.mongodb.com/), a powerful NoSQL database system. MongoDB facilitates the storage and retrieval of data in a flexible and scalable manner.
- The Backend is Empowered by Node.js üöÄ (https://nodejs.org/en). Efficient, versatile, and high-performing.
